Hello there!

I am Kshitish Ghate. My research interests lie in understanding how social biases are learned by artificial intelligence (AI) and algorithmic systems, and the consequences of such learned biases on society. I am interested in exploring how AI systems can be improved to deliver trustworthy and ethical decisions.

I am currently a second year Graduate Student at the <a href='https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/'>Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon</a>, pursuing a Master's degree in Language Technologies where I am fortunate to be advised by <a href='https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/people/faculty/diab-mona.html'>Dr. Mona Diab </a>.
