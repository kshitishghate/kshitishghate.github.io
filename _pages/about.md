Hello there!

I am Kshitish Ghate. My research interests lie in understanding how social biases are learned by artificial intelligence (AI) and algorithmic systems, and the consequences of such learned biases on society. I am interested in exploring how AI systems can be improved to deliver trustworthy and ethical decisions.

I am currently a final year student at BITS Pilani pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science and a Master's in Economics. 

<b>I am applying for Fall'23 Ph.D. positions in AI fairness and computational social science!</b>
